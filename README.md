Animated Underline Navigation for Bootstrap

A lightweight JavaScript and CSS solution that enhances any Bootstrap navbar with:

Smooth 1px white underline on hover (animates from left to right over 0.3 s).

Scroll-based active state using IntersectionObserver to automatically highlight the link corresponding to the section in view.

Simply include the provided CSS and JS in your project (or use the provided menu-observer.js and custom stylesheet) to get an elegant, modern navigation experience with zero dependencies beyond Bootstrap.
